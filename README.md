✨ My Github intro in short ✨
- 👋 **Say Hi**

  _Hey there! Hi to you that you are visiting my page here on Github!_

- 🧍 **Who I am**

  _I’m Giuseppe, I am a Researcher at Tilburg University and I am on my way to complete my PhD in the same university._
  
- 👀 **What my interests are**

  _I’m interested in understanding social phenomena as well as biological processes, coding, code optimization in algorithms, modeling, optimization problems in statictical and probabilistic models. In my PhD I study relational event networks (read [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x) the first paper about REM) and investigate on the presence of time-dependent dynamics of past interactions among actors on the imminent future. I have already contributed to the literature on REM with a semi-parametric and a parametric method which both answer (in different ways) the question of how much a past action weighs on an actor's decision making process when such actor is undertaking its next (future) interaction._
  
- 🌱 **What I am learning**

  _I’m currently learning the limits and the potentials of time-sensitive extensions of the REM that can help a researcher to estimate the time-dynamic of specific behaviors that are observed in a relational event sequence. I am also very much into learning the potential of C/C++ and its libraries in interfacing with the machine in order to minimize the high cost in computational burden and storage required by the computation of statistics in REM.
